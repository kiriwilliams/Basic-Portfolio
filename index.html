                    I grew up in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. As a young person, my favorite hobby was reading. I have
                    always loved to draw, especially monsters and fantastical beasts. Until my junior year of college I
                    always believed in a deep, secret part of my mind that I really was an alien, and that someday my
                    alien family would come and take me home to a beautiful and peaceful world. Then I accepted that I
                    really am just a human, and I will only ever live on Earth in my vulnerable human body. That's okay,
                    though, because the Earth is also really beautiful, and so is having a human body. I get better at
                    it every day.

                    My favorite season is summer. Growing plants smell so refreshing, and I love the sounds that insects
                    make in the summer. There are also all sorts of birds visiting and singing. The longer days are
                    really good; the more sun the better. I think daylight savings is a bad idea, and we should always
                    use the summer hours without changing the clocks ever.
